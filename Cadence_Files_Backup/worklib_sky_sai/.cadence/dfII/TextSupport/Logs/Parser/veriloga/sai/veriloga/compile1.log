Warning from spectre during AHDL compile.
    WARNING (VACOMP-1087):
        "/home/saik/worklib_sky/reram/sai/Practice/veriloga/veriloga.va", line
        3: Encountered Verilog `timescale directive. Verilog-AMS requires a
        `default_transition directive to set the default transition or a local
        transition setting for transition or Z-transform filters. While the
        Verilog-A language will use `timescale in the absence of a
        `default_transition directive, you should always use
        `default_transition to set the default transition time for transition
        or Z-transform (zi_*) filters.
